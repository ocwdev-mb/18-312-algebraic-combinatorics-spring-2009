Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Algebra I (18.701) or Modern Algebra (18.703)

Course Content
--------------

This is an introductory course in algebraic combinatorics. No prior knowledge of combinatorics is expected, but I will assume a familiarity with linear algebra and finite groups. We will cover a number of topics chosen to show the beauty and power of techniques in algebraic combinatorics. Rigorous mathematical proofs are expected.

*   Rational generating functions and Recurrence relations
*   Walks in graphs and the Radon transform
*   Adjacency and Laplacian matrices of graphs
*   Introduction to Posets and Sperner's theorem
*   Partitions and Euler's Pentagonal theorem
*   Young diagrams and q-binomial coefficients
*   Young Tableaux and introduction to Schur functions
*   Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm and applications
*   Polya theory and group actions on boolean algebras
*   Matrix Tree theorem, Spanning trees, and Eulerian digraphs

Requirements
------------

Homework: Homework will be assigned and collected in class, typically every week. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.

Exams: There will be two in-class quizzes during the semester.

Research Project: You will be expected to write a 5-10 page expository paper on a topic in algebraic combinatorics related to the course material.

Participation: Participation in class is encouraged. Please feel free to stop me and ask questions. Otherwise, I might stop and ask you questions.
